description: Use ready-made GSAP animated components in your React and Next.js apps with Tailwind styling
---

A growing set of animated components powered by GSAP, ready to drop into any React or Next.js project.
You can copy them, paste them, and make them your own.

More animations, interactive sections, and design tools are coming soon. Stay tuned.

## Motivation

We made PaceUI to bring more ease and joy into the design process. The components don’t just look good, they move with purpose. Now that GSAP is fully open, it’s a great time to bring more life and motion into your work without the extra weight.

<br/>
We’ve always loved how Shadcn keeps things clean and effortless. This project is my take on that mindset, with animation built in from the very beginning.
